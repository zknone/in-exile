      <div className="font-bold">Residency cards for an artist in exile at an art school</div>
      <div>
        This project originated within the framework of “PUZLP – artists in exile in art schools,”
        which brings together Belgian art schools (ESA Saint-Luc Brussels, ERG), the National
        Association of French Higher Art Schools (ANdÉA), and the workshop for artists in exile
        (aa-e) with support from the European Union&rdquo;s Erasmus+ program.

        A transnational reflection on the challenges of organizing residencies in art schools has
        made it possible to identify areas of concern, and then to create a facilitating welcome
        tool designed as a deck of cards. The proposed tool synthesizes recommendations and
        &#34;best practices,&#34; to be adjusted according to the artist&rdquo;s situation, context,
        and the possibilities of each school. Everything stems from the desire for mutual enrichment
        of schools and artists in exile.

        These “welcome cards” are enriched by discussions with PUZLP partners, art schools, and
        actors from the Belgian project “Exile and Creation,” and dialogues with artists in exile
        hosted in art schools. An initial residency prototype conducted in 2020 at ESAAA in Annecy
        with members of the aa-e contributed to adapting the Pause program carried by the Collège de
        France for artists. Since then, half of the French art and design schools have hosted or are
        hosting dozens of artists in exile from all backgrounds for research, creation, or teaching
        residencies.
